## METAL ENGINEERING WORKS
# INTODUCTION
This project is a web-based information system developed for a small metal fabrication business. The purpose of the system is to simplify and automate the process of handling customer service requests  for metal services such as cutting, welding, bending, and finishing.

In traditional metal workshops, customers usually request project estimates manually via in person. This system replaces that process with a simple online interface, allowing customers to submit detailed project specifications, calculate estimated costs, and optionally proceed with the service.
